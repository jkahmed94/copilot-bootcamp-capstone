# Coding Guidelines

This project follows clear, maintainable coding standards to ensure code quality and consistency across the frontend and backend.

## General Formatting
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for JavaScript)
- Prefer single quotes for strings
- Limit line length to 100 characters
- Remove trailing whitespace
- Add blank lines between logical sections
- Use descriptive variable and function names

## Import Organization
- Group imports by type: standard libraries, third-party modules, local files
- Place imports at the top of each file
- Remove unused imports
- Use relative paths for local modules

## Linter Usage
- Use ESLint for JavaScript code
- Fix all linter warnings and errors before committing
- Follow recommended rules for style and best practices

## Best Practices
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious code
- Validate all user input on both frontend and backend
- Handle errors gracefully and provide clear messages
- Write modular, reusable code
- Avoid global variables
- Prefer const and let over var
- Use strict equality (===) for comparisons

## Code Review
- Submit pull requests for all changes
- Request review from team members
- Address review feedback promptly

## Documentation
- Document public functions and modules
- Update documentation when code changes

By following these guidelines, we maintain a clean, readable, and reliable codebase that is easy to extend and maintain.
